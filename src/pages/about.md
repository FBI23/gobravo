_Gobravo was built by the people for the people._

Gobravo is an app that allows users to access emergency assistance, all at the push of a button. It is operational across the country where there is network coverage. Users request help by pressing the button on the app, Gobravo operators then call back to verify the details of the request then dispatch the emergency service providers required. The innovation works to complement the 10111 police service. Other than the data cost levied by network providers, Gobravo is free to use. The data issue is a concern that the developers have been working to mitigate because it’s currently a barrier to accessing the help the app offers.

Promising a 24-hour, seven days a week call centre of responders, the app is free on both Android and IOS. In 2019, Gobravo launched a family safety feature, which allows people to perpetually share their location and movements with the people they choose. This also comes with real-time notifications when they leave or arrive at a location. The service is encrypted and only those you’ve given access to your movements will have access to your information and, in the case of an emergency, your information is shared with emergency services.
